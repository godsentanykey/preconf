Prerequisites

- Ansible version 2.8+
- Python 2 & 3
- Newly created Ubuntu or Centos VM with already created user and corresponding public ssh key in authorized_keys.
For simplicity create user "ansible" and insert its ssh-key ansible.pub which located in files directory.

Installing

After downloading a repository:
1. Open inventory file in project root and specify ip-addresses of hosts you want to preconfigure.
2. Run command ssh-keyscan -H {IP_ADDRESS} >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts where {IP_ADDRESS} - ip-address of host you want to preconfigure. In other way first run will be terminated.
3. In project root run "ansible-playbook preconfigure.yml"
4. Wait until playbook finishes all tasks.
5. Now all users specified in {ubuntu/centos}/vars/main.yml variable usersToCreate are able to log in newly created VM.
